Title: n-dimensional kernel smoothing for Cox proportional hazards regression models
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Sjoberg", "Daniel D.", email = "danieldsjoberg@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: The sjosmooth was developed to calculate kernel-smoothed survival probability estimates from the Cox regression model (survival::coxph). The package's primary function is called sm.timeto, which provides n-dimensional kernel-smoothed survival probability estimates.
