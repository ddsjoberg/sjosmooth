# sjosmooth <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height=140/>

The goal of **sjosmooth** is to provide kernel smoothed estimates for time to event data.

## Installation

You can install the released version of sjosmooth from GitHub with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("ddsjoberg/sjosmooth")
```

## Functions

The **sjosmooth** package has two primary functions.  The first calculates kernel-weighted regression models (`sm_regression`).  The user specifies a regression model and a variable for weighting, and `sm_regression` will estimate a weighted regression model for each unique value of the specified variable.

The second function (`sm_predict`) calculates kernel-weighted predictions from regression models (i.e. outcomes that can be calculated from the `predict` function).

The package was written generally, such that any regression model should be compatible.  However, only `survival::coxph()`, and `survival::survreg()`, `stats::lm()`, and `stats::glm()` models were tested.
